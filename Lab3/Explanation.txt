Hello professor Daniel Buckstein,

I'm sorry for not being able to work on this assignment. I do not believe I am ready for your style of teach this course. I was taking this course last year with
Professor Sajid Farooq. I will be as honest as possible when I say that my personal issues leading me to retake this semester have ruined my chances of passing this major. 
The style in which you teach is astronomically harder than how Professor Farooq's. The cirriculum in which you teach is so vastly different to a point where your class is 
meant to have Sajid's class before it. The topics you cover are not intro topics. You do not cover all the basics like Sajid Farooq does and for some reason you are scrambling
this with c++ when we haven't even learned the traditional GLSL language all that much. I am sorry that I am unable to keep up with your teaching ethics. I will be discussing a 
withdrawal with Dr. Wei Kian Chen but due to me being on Academic Probation, I doubt I will be able to leave this class. Thanks for trying to teach me though and again, I'm sorry.
